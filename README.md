SEMANTIC HTML CHANGES

Comments were added to the beginning and end of different parts of the webpage for easier identification of each area

The objective of this assignment was the Organization of the code provided to remove redundant styling and to add Semantic HTML elements to the page layout.

To achieve this I changed the layout from repeated divs used throughout the page layout to more Semantic HTML elements.

The parent <div> was changed to <main> and the correspnding 3 child <div> were changed to <article>

Side colum veritcal <div> was changed to an <aside>

Images were given alt attributes to meet accssibility standards

Comments distinguishing which stlye is being applied to which area of the html document were provided for ease of use and organizational purposes
